# Rhoen [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/lkrieg/rhoen.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/lkrieg/rhoen)

## Overview
   First person 3D RPG engine written in C++ with OpenGL 3.x.
   Will be using only a small subset of C++99, mostly classes, namespaces,
   and operator overloading. Won't be using STL, templates, exceptions, etc.
   Also no CMake or Autotools, just plain old GNU Makefiles and a script for
   configuration. Docs will be generated by Doxygen. Unit tests are done
   using the CATCH library (propably combined with some Mock Library).

## Documentation
   All documentation can be found [here](https://lkrieg.github.io/rhoen/).
   Those documents are generated with Doxygen on the CI Server and then
   deployed to Github Pages after each successful build. If you want to
   generate them by hand call "make docs" in the projects root directory.
   Also make sure you have Doxygen and Graphviz installed.
