# Rhoen [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/lkrieg/rhoen.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/lkrieg/rhoen)

## Overview
   First person 3D RPG engine written in C++ with OpenGL 3.x.
   Will be using only a small subset of C++99, mostly classes, namespaces,
   and operator overloading. Won't be using STL, templates, exceptions, etc.
   Also no CMake or Autotools, just plain old GNU Makefiles and a script for
   configuration. Docs will be generated by Doxygen. Unit tests are done
   using the CATCH library (propably combined with some Mock Library).
